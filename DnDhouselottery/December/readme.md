Step by step guide to adding a new optional section:

Step 1:

Determine the data entity entries to be added and which database will be required.

There are 2 main data entities we usually use: DND - Lottery. Application, DND - Lottery Form Controls.

In total there are 5 data entities DND - Lottery uses.

Step 2: 

Add the new field(s) into the required form or form based app.

Open “form based app”: DND - Lottery Application Control form (this is how each section that appears in the main form DND - Lottery Application gets assigned)

Find and open “New Form” type DND - Lottery Application and add the new section in the appropriate section 

Save and checkin

Checkin all files and publish!

Step 3:

Add the new fields into the required form or processed based app.

There is only one “process based app”: DND - Lottery Application

Edit the “task form” called: Lottery Application Submission

Add the new section in the appropriate section. Tip: Most of the time the section we need to update is the “Applicant Details”

Add the rules to show or hide controls of fields if necessary

Go to the first section called “introduction”, and update the subform called “GetDevelopmentDetails” and add a “textbox”. The label and internal name should be begin with “SF” e.g - label: ‘SF Display Domestic Violence Question’, machine name: 'SFDisplayDomesticViolenceQuestion'. 

Update the auto-lookup field ‘Get Development Information’ (it is below the subform). Double click to open the field and click on ‘configure’. Look for the field ‘Lookup Source’ and click on the edit pencil icon to edit the list.

Make sure the correct data entity is selected and the data mapping is selected. Add the correct naming convention to map the field added to the ‘Subform’ to the ‘auto-lookup’ field. E.g App Variable: ‘SFDisplaySupportiveServicesQuestion’, Display Name: ‘SupportiveServicesPref__u’

Save and checkin

Checkin all files and publish!

Tips:

If you can’t see data entity fields refresh page and open folders processes → DND - Lottery Application → data sources. Open it, and refresh data entity drop-down. Check fields to make sure the new one(s) you just created are selected (checked). If they are not select them. Same thing applies for all data sources in all the forms.
