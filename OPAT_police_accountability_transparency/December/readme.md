OPAT would like to have the following changes made to the complaint form:

After preferred language, they would like to include "Are you are were you a BPD employee at the time of this incident?". The 4 options available for them to select are: "No", "Yes, I was at the time of the incident but am not presently", "Yes, I am now but was not at the time of the incident", and "Yes, I was at the time of the incident and still am".

In the incident information section, they would like to update the question about ICE involvement to: "Was the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) or any other federal agency (FBI, DHS, HSI, Coast Guard, etc.) involved in this incident?", and they would like to add an "I don't know" option in addition to Yes/No for this question. ("I don't know" should NOT be added as an option to the question concerning BPD).

Add a required "AM/PM" option for the time of the incident.

Update "Incident precinct (if Blank please enter if known)" to "Incident precinct (if known)".

Update "Incident Address" to "Incident address" (lowercase A)

Update "Were you arrested during this incident?" to "Were you arrested or detained during this incident?"
